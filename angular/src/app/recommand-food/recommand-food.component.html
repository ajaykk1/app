<p>In recent years, the rapidly escalating pace of change in the food supply and the growing variety of uses for food data have greatly enhanced the need for transparent and easily accessible information about the nutrients and other components in foods and food products. This need requires a new approach to analyzing, compiling, and presenting food profile information in a scientifically rigorous way. FoodData Central continues to embody this new approach.
    FoodData Central contains five distinct types of data that provide information on nutrients and other food components. Although these data types have unique purposes and attributes, they can be used in complementary ways to achieve a variety of research and related objectives. Two of the data types—Foundation Foods and Experimental Foods—provide data that have never previously been available. These data types will be the primary focus of efforts as FoodData Central is expanded and developed in coming years.
    
    Foundation Foods includes values derived from analyses for food components, including nutrients on a diverse range of foods and ingredients as well as extensive underlying metadata. These metadata include the number of samples, sampling location, date of collection, analytical approaches used, and if appropriate, agricultural information such as genotype and production practices. The enhanced depth and transparency of Foundation Foods data can provide valuable insights into the many factors that influence variability in nutrient and food component profiles. The goal of Foundation Foods will be to, over time, expand the number of basic foods and ingredients and their underlying data.
    Experimental Foods contains foods produced, acquired, or studied under unique conditions, such as alternative management systems, experimental genotypes, or research/analytical protocols. The foods in this data type may not be commercially available to the public or the data may expand information about the specific food. Experimental Foods are for research purposes and may not be appropriate as a reference for the consumer or for diet planning. Experimental Foods data may also be available through links to relevant agricultural research data sources, such as the AgCROS. The data in Experimental Foods may include (or link to) variables such as genetics, environmental inputs and outputs, supply chains, economic considerations, and nutrition research. These data will allow users to examine a range of factors used that may affect the profiles of food components, including nutrients and resulting dietary intakes as well as the sustainability of agricultural and dietary food systems.
